<div class="article-content">
    <p>Last weekend I participated in GMTK 2025 with one of my friends and produced "On Repeat" in 96 hours. </p>
<p><img src="static/imgs/on-repeat.gif" alt="on-repeat.gif"><br></p>
<p>The theme for this jam was "Loop" and our minds immediately went to "music loops", so we made a rhythm game about running around a vinyl disk hitting notes on beat.</p>
<p>Unlike many of my past game jams, I decided to take this one a little easier. It was great to collaborate with someone who had never participated in a jam before, and realizing our idea together.</p>
<p>My friend took charge of all the musical elements, and I made the art and code for the game.<br />
