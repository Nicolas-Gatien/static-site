    <p>My favourite board game at the moment is an asymmetrical multiplayer game called Root.<br />
<img src="/static/imgs/root-game.png" alt="root-game.png"><br></p>
<p>The premise of the game is that each player controls a woodland faction. Each faction plays their turn in an entirely different manner, with the end goal of scoring victory points. The environment of the game takes place in clearings in the forest, and each player makes use of the clearings in different ways.</p>
<p>Recently I've been itching to create a new card game. In the past, I've tried my hand at some Trading Card Games (TCGs) and they were always a blast to create.</p>
<p>When I was in middle school I made a game I named "Planet Crash" using random art I found online. The name was heavily inspired by my favourite video game at the time (Comet Crash), and the gameplay was very similar to Magic the Gathering.</p>
<p><img src="/static/imgs/planet-crash-cards.png" alt="planet-crash-cards.png"><br></p>
<p>Around the same time I "finished" my first game, I started working on a second game I called "Cubicles". For this one, my goal was to create all the art myself so I could eventually produce and sell the game. I created many prototype cards, and played multiple games with my siblings to test out the mechanics.</p>
<p><img src="/static/imgs/cubicles-prototype-cards.png" alt="cubicles-prototype-cards.png"><br></p>
<p>I was slowly re-drawing my prototypical cards into more "polished" designs. Similarly to my last game, the gameplay was also quite similar to Magic the Gathering. I couldn't shake the similarity of the two, and instead of redesigning my game, and eventually stopped working on it.</p>
<p><img src="/static/imgs/cubicles-redrawing.png" alt="cubicles-redrawing.png"><br></p>
<p>I would like to make and release a new TCG based on some similar ideas to the mechanics of root. The deck of cards the player is drawing from would be a specifically designed faction, where each card is a maneuver they can do on their turn. Instead of discarding cards to a discard pile, all the cards they use in one turn and just shuffled back into their deck.</p>
<p>Then, there are environment cards that move players closer to their win condition of they can leverage them properly. Importantly, the environment cards should be able to be used by any of the players, but in different ways.</p>
