    <p>Continuing from my experiments two days ago <a href="/first-try-visualizing-mea-data" class="internal">first-try-visualizing-mea-data</a>, I was honestly a little underwhelmed by the result of the visualization. I randomly thought "maybe I can show the difference from one frame to the next?" I had seen a few videos like this on Youtube, but I can not for find any examples of them for some reason.</p>
<p>As an example, here's a gif I generated of myself fencing with this filter active. White pixels represent change since the last frame (or movement) black pixels show no change (stability).</p>

<p>Using the same concept on the visualization I generated two days ago (in the above mentioned post):</p>
<p><img src="../static/imgs/electrode_position_animation.gif" alt="electrode_position_animation.gif"><br></p>
<p>I was able to generate this (red frames at the beginning show when it loops):</p>
<p><img src="../static/imgs/7month_2950_diff_animation_1000.gif" alt="7month_2950_diff_animation_1000.gif"><br></p>
<p>I'm still just fumbling about seeing what works, so there's a high likelihood that majority of the activity shown here is just noise in the recordings. What I find promising are the bursts of white pixels that occur from time to time.</p>
