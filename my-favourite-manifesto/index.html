    <p>My favourite manifest is the "Cult of Done manifesto", admittedly, it's the only manifesto I've read in its entirety.</p>
<p>Here's a link to the original post: <a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13</a></p>
<p>Over the last month I haven't made any new posts. Mainly because I haven't had as much time to work on <strong>my</strong> ideas now that I'm in university. I committed to too many things at the start of the year and I'm currently in the process of cutting down my commitments so I can keep making my ideas. With that said, I want to start being more intentional about rule #12:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>I have so many ideas. The problem is I don't have enough time to work on them all. Additionally, I normally only make posts about what I'm <strong><em>working</em></strong> on. Not the random events of my life.</p>
<p>Writing about my ideas will also keep them in a repository. Once I do have time, and I finish my other projects, I can come and read what I've written about. That way the benefit is two-fold.</p>
<ol>
<li>I make posts and continue to share my work with the world</li>
<li>I keep a repository of ideas and projects I would like to complete</li>
</ol>
