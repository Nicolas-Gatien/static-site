    <p>Imposter syndrome is not a catch all term for feeling inadequate. I've thought for a while that the term imposter syndrome has been inflated, and is applied in contexts where it should not be.</p>
<p>In this piece, I aim to make distinctions between the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Feeling "imposter syndrome" because I am new</li>
<li>Feeling "imposter syndrome" because I am lying</li>
<li>Suffering from imposter syndrome</li>
</ol>
<p>I'll start by providing a definition of imposter syndrome:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the persistent inability to believe that one's success is deserved or has been legitimately achieved as a result of one's own efforts or skills.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>1. I am new</h2>
<p>Being young has many perks. Among them is the fact that I am comparatively bad at most things. In any specialized environment, the surrounding people are likely to be older, and have had more time to hone their skills.</p>
<p>There is a clear, and real gap between my current level, and the people around me.</p>
<p>This gap can be intimidating to the point that I might feel "I don't belong." I prefer referring to this feeling as crippling aspiration instead of imposter syndrome, the reason being that the solution differs.</p>
<p>When I feel crippling aspiration, the solution is not the be more confident in my abilities. It's to acknowledge that I know nothing, and to pull myself up by my bootstraps. The solution to crippling aspiration is to put in the work and to improve.</p>
<p>This is often amazingly straightforward. Especially since those around me are more skilled and are likely to be motivated to impart me with their knowledge.</p>
<p>Crippling aspiration differs from imposter syndrome in two distinct ways. The first being that the feeling is not persistent. I only feel in the wrong place when I get started, and it quickly goes away when I begin to be of use. The second key difference is that I don't yet have any successes to feel underserved about. I'm new, and I haven't succeeded yet.</p>
<h2>2. I am lying</h2>
<p>I feel guilty when I lie. This has been an amazing mechanism to help me stop lying. I am overcome by a similar, yet distinct feeling upon my usage of hyperbole.</p>
<p>The strongest I've experienced this feeling was while writing a sales page for my physical monthly newsletter. For a three month period, I attempted to sell a physical monthly newsletter as an upsell for a booklet I had written. I stopped writing this letter not because of a lack of monetary success, but an ever growing guilty conscious.</p>
<p>This guilt came from the fact I knew I was offering a bad deal. But in order to make it sound good, I made extensive use of hyperbole in my sales page.</p>
<p>Upon discussing this guilt, I was told that I simply needed more confidence in my abilities, and that this was imposter syndrome. I can assure you that it was not. It was my conscious attempting to tell me to stop offering a bad deal.</p>
<p>The reason I know this was guilt and not imposter syndrome, is that no confidence in my abilities would change the fact it was a bad deal. Even if I was the best writer on the planet, the reality was that the topics of my newsletter, could be packaged as a book, and be sold for a much better value for the reader.</p>
<p>Guilt differs from imposter syndrome in one major way: it's right about me. When I feel guilty about the lack of legitimacy in my methods, it's because there's an actual lack of legitimacy in my methods. Guilt is telling me to go fix it, and I should listen.</p>
<h2>3. True imposter syndrome</h2>
<p>If I'm not new, and I haven't told a lie, but I still feel that my success is not deserved, that is imposter syndrome. Especially if it doesn't go away.</p>
<p>With these added constraints I've noticed that I very rarely feel "imposter syndrome." I'm much more prone to crippling aspiration, and once I've built up my skills, the feeling that I don't belong goes away.</p>
<p>Calling something that isn't imposter syndrome, by a false name, gives it more power, and importantly guides me in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>So I stopped, and I think others would benefit from stopping as well.</p>
