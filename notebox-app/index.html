    <p>I regularly make use of my box of notecards when I'm reading new material. I find this system of taking notes and anchoring them to previous ideas works remarkably well for me. I would like to have a system similar when I am not able to access my physical notecards. Many people refer to a system like this as a Zettelkasten.</p>
<p>Many apps, such as Obsidian or Logseq market themselves as capable of implementing a Zettelkasten system. While I believe this to be true, it doesn't quite encompass the same feel as my physical cards.</p>
<p>I've been thinking of making a notecard focused app. Where the notes are on digital notecards. Here are the specifications I'm thinking of:</p>
<ol>
<li>A notecard is restrained to a maximum number of characters (about 3x the twitter character limit)</li>
<li>A notecard must have a location in the box (determined by an address)</li>
<li>Writing another notecard's address in the text of a notecard turns the address into a clickable hyperlink.</li>
<li>While viewing a notecard, the two notecards preceding and proceeding it are displayed beneath and above.</li>
<li>Notecards cannot be erased or moved once added and placed in the box</li>
<li>Once a notecard is saved, the text on the notecard cannot be deleted, but it can be struck-through and more text can be added (if it's not yet at the character limit)</li>
<li>It must be a downloadable app and work offline</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>That is all I would implement for the first version, and then I would begin using it. Based on how I use it, I might make a few adjustments but this is all I need.</p>
