    <p>I just finished rereading my favourite book, "Show Your Work" by <a href="https://austinkleon.com/">Austin Kleon</a>. Every time I read it, it fills me with creative motivation. It reminds me that what I should be doing is actually quite simple: do good work and talk about it online.</p>
<p>This book is filled with illustrations and snippets of blackout poetry. Almost every other page has a piece of art for you to enjoy. When I finished reading it, I felt inspired and took a trip to the nearest thrift store to get my hands on a piece of text I could black out to make poetry.</p>
<p>I looked through most of the paperback books on their shelves to find the ones with the largest font size. I figured it would be easier to get started with fewer words on the page.</p>

<p>I found these two books, one from 1914 and I'm excited to give this a shot.</p>
