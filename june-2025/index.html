    <p>Hello! 👋</p>
<p>I haven't written an update like this in a while so I will keep it short. Here's what I've been up to in June!</p>
<h3>1. I'm writing a poetry collection</h3>
<p>It's blackout poetry, so technically I'm not writing the poems, but I am composing the blanks. I've got about 30 poems pilled up now, but I'm just writing them passively when I have a few minutes to spare. I plan to publish the collections about a year from now once I have composed enough poems to pick and choose which ones I want to include in the collection.</p>
<p>I show two of my poems in this blog post: <a href="/my-first-blackout-poems" class="internal">my-first-blackout-poems</a></p>
<h3>2. I got accepted at Carleton University</h3>
<p>I'm going to Carleton in the fall in Cognitive Science! My admission is conditional on the completion of two additional grade 12 highschool credits, so over the month of June I've been working pretty relentlessly to complete my credits in time.</p>
<p>Today I completed the first of the two credits, and through the course of July I will be working through my second one.</p>
<h3>3. I'm learning about brain data</h3>
<p>For the first time this month I managed to visualize brain signals. This is a graph plotting signals from an EEG dataset. I wrote more about it in this post: <a href="/graphing-eeg-data" class="internal">graphing-eeg-data</a></p>

<hr />
<p>Those are my highlights of this month.</p>
<p>I'll be back in your inbox in ~30 days.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading 👋</p>
<p>Nicolas Gatien</p>
