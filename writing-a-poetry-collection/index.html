<div class="article-content">
    <p>Since my last dispatch about blackout poetry (<a href="/my-first-blackout-poems" class="internal">my-first-blackout-poems</a>) I've continued to write poems with this method and I've had a blast doing so. I plan to release a poetry collection in a year or two once I have written a few hundred poems. Then I can be more selective about which ones to include in the colelection instead of publishing everything I've created.</p>
<p>I see this more as a background project that gets completed passively until I feel the time is right and I've written enough poems to publish the collection.</p>
<p>Until then, I will periodically publish a poem or two as my dispatches.</p>
