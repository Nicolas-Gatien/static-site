<div class="article-content">
    <p>My <a href="/utilitarian-ethics-in-minecraft" class="internal">utilitarian-ethics-in-minecraft</a> project initially revolved around maximizing the utility of a single Minecraft village. This has now shifted to maximizing global utility in the agent's world. So I had to think of a way to describe a minecraft world to a LLM in a token-efficient manner.</p>
<p>My current approach is to first retrieve a list of all the blocks around the agent (65 blocks in all directions). Then I loop through each block and determine whether it is near the surface or not. I do this using the skyLight level of each block, which is the amount of light the block receives from the sky at daylight.</p>
<p>I'm currently only paying attention to blocks that receive full light from the sky, because it determines the contour of the world. Eventually I would like to map caves as well, but I haven't quite figured that one out yet. For now I'm sticking to biomes. Each block in the outer layer of the world is added to a sum for its corresponding biome. Each biome takes the average position of all the blocks at its surface, and that becomes the biome's position.</p>
<p>With this information, I can generate a small piece of text like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>The following biomes are around you: plains, stony_shore, meadow, 

The plains is to the South and is located at: -989 78 2520. It makes up 96% of your surroundings.
The stony_shore is to the West and is located at: -1054 72 2452. It makes up 4% of your surroundings.
The meadow is to the South and is located at: -995 91 2592. It makes up 0% of your surroundings.
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is currently all the information my agent is using to make plans (as well as its existing context). There's obviously some things missing:</p>
<ol>
<li>it has no way of detecting structures</li>
<li>it has no way of detecting caves</li>
<li>it has no description of entities in the area</li>
<li>it has no way of detecting player-made structures</li>
<li>it has no way of knowing the positions of individual blocks</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe I could include a highly specific description of the blocks in a 5x5 grid around the player, and a broad description of everything else?</p>
