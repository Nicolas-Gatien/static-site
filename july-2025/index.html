    <p>Hello! 👋</p>
<p>Here's a quick update of what I've been up to in July!</p>
<h3>1. I'm visualizing HD brain data</h3>
<p>In June, I managed to graph some EEG data. In July, I stepped it up and made some visualizations of neuronal activity collected from HD microelectrode arrays. Here's one of the visualizations I generated.</p>
<p><img src="static/imgs/7month_2953_diff_animation_1000_0.gif" alt="7month_2953_diff_animation_1000_0.gif"><br></p>
<p>You can see the bursts of white pixels showing activity in the recorded neurons. Many of the grey pixels are just noise. I wrote a little more about how I made this visualization in this post: <a href="/visualizing-mea-data-difference" class="internal">visualizing-mea-data-difference</a></p>
<p>My next steps are to perform spike sorting on the dataset to figure out what part of this is noise, and what part is actual neuron activity.</p>
<h3>2. I competed in the Canadian Broadsword Nationals</h3>
<p>I train in a sport called HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) and one of the disciplines I train is highland broadsword. Last weekend I competed in the Canadian Broadsword Nationals in the intermediate division and scored silver! Next year I'll be competing at the advanced level with the best broadsword fighters in Canada.</p>

<p>Those are my highlights of this month.</p>
