    <p>In June I went out to the thrift store and bought two books to get started with blackout poetry: <a href="/shopping-for-books" class="internal">shopping-for-books</a>. 53 days later, and I have used every page in one of those two books to make poems. That book is of course "Speaking of Operations" by Irvin S. Cobb.</p>
<p>Here are three of my favourite poems from the pages of this 1915 comedy:<br />

<p>Once I was done with all the pages that had text, I still had a few illustration pages left in the book. Since this is a considerably old book (published in 1915) I decided to take the illustrations and the remaining pages and collage them inside my journal.</p>
