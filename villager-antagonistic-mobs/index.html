    <p>I'm working on a simulated "omnipotent" utilitarian AI in Minecraft. In my previous post (<a href="/utilitarian-ethics-in-minecraft" class="internal">utilitarian-ethics-in-minecraft</a>) I briefly mentioned implementing an effect that simply deals damage to all entities at a regular interval. Though this may work as a mechanism, it feels a little boring.</p>
<p>I remembered today that villagers in Minecraft have a few default "enemies" that will attack them. Additionally, the naturally spawning Iron Golems in the village would act as a defence. The hostile entities as far as I'm aware are Pillagers, Ravagers, Vindicators, Evokers, Vexes, Witches, Zombies and Husks. Maybe there are more I'm not currently thinking of?</p>
<p>Perhaps instead of dealing automatic damage to all entities in the village, I can increase the natural spawn rate of all these entities. This would add another layer of complexity for the AI to balance. Building defences surrounding the village, or increasing the quantity of iron golems could both be viable methods to deal with this threat.</p>
<p>In either case, I think it would lead to more interesting outcomes compared to automatically dealing a set rate of damage.</p>
