    <p>I just added a page in my writings for my book: <a href="/how-to-build-a-digital-assistant" class="internal">how-to-build-a-digital-assistant</a></p>
<p>I published this book in 2024 after working on it for about year. I believe most of the content inside has become irrelevant as the OpenAI API continues to receive updates, but I'm still proud of the book as a whole. Of course, I cringe, a lot... when I go through the pages and read my writing.</p>
<p>Anyways, I'm not planning on ever doing another print run for this book, so I figure I might as well put up the PDF for free. Maybe someone will find it useful? Who knows...</p>
