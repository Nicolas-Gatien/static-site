    <p>I re-organized the home page of my website to prioritize my dispatches. These daily updates are the most important thing people can find on my whole website, so it makes more sense to have them displayed on the front page by default.</p>
<p>I also combined my newsletters with the dispatches page. Upon thinking about the separation of posts from dispatches, I thought it would make more sense to put my monthly recaps with my daily updates. That way it's possible to get a recap of the whole month without needing to go digging through my posts.</p>
<p>Additionally I renamed the posts section to 'writings' and archived most of the pages I had there. Many of those pages were articles I wrote 4-5 years ago when I was in high school. I wrote them mainly with the intention to build credibility, or at the time, what I thought of as 'legitimacy', that way I could link them in my cold emails. While these articles were interesting relics of my internet journey, they are not part of what I want people to see when they visit my website for the first time.</p>
<p>Maybe some day in the future I will create an easter egg to access the archives, but for now, they are tucked away.</p>
<p>I left a few writings accessible, specifically the ones that are relevant to my current areas of interest, and my two opinion pieces. I would like to also provide a PDF download for the book I wrote a couple years ago, but that's a project for another time. I also plan to link any academic publications I end up writing during my university career in the writings section.</p>
<p>This new organization makes more sense to me. It prioritizes my daily progress updates, which is the main item I want people to see upon visiting my site, and allows those more curious to find writings relevant to my current areas of interest.</p>
